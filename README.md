## Logistical Performance Dashboard üìä
**Individual | Microsoft Excel**

### Project Description
In this project, I used Excel to create an interactive dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for a logistics company. The dashboard allows the user to filter and analyze data by different criteria, such as mileage, region, revenue, and driver. The dashboard also provides visualizations of the data, such as charts, tables, and maps, to help the user identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

**The main objectives of this project were to**:
- Demonstrate my proficiency in using Excel functions, formulas, and features, such as pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting, data validation, and VLOOKUP.
- Apply data analysis and visualization techniques to transform raw data into meaningful insights for business decision-making.
- Showcase my creativity and attention to detail in designing a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing dashboard.

### Tasks
- ‚úÖ Task 1 - Project Understanding
- ‚úÖ Task 2 - Data Cleaning & Modelling
- ‚úÖ Task 3 - Data Visualization and Storytelling

### Tools and Visualization
- ‚öôÔ∏è Tool: Excel
- üíª Visualization: Excel (Pivot tables)
- üóÇÔ∏è Source Dataset: Employers Internal Company Dataset

## Kenya Covid-19 Dashboard Project
**Individual | Tableau Public, SSMS**

### Project Description
In this project, I used MySQL and Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides timely and crucial insights into the COVID-19 situation in Kenya. The dashboard offers real-time data on key COVID-19 metrics, such as new active cases, new confirmed cases, new deaths, and recoveries. The dashboard also provides visualizations of the data, such as charts, maps, and tables, to help the user understand the trends, patterns, and impacts of the pandemic.

**The main objectives of this project were to**:
- Demonstrate my proficiency in using MySQL and Tableau for data management and analysis, such as querying, joining, filtering, aggregating, and transforming data.
- Apply data visualization techniques to present the data in an effective and engaging way, such as choosing appropriate chart types, colors, labels, and annotations.
- Showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills in designing a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that meets the needs and expectations of the target audience.

The data source for this project was a public dataset of COVID-19 cases in Kenya that was updated daily by the Ministry of Health. The dataset contained information about the date, location, gender, age, and status of each case.

### Tools and Visualization
